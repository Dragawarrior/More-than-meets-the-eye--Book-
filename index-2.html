                Hero: Reika Channing

             <h3>
                Dum spiro spero - While I breathe, I hope
             </h3>

             <p>
                Reika was on a museum trip with her younger brother when she was transported to another world inside a stone carving. She is brought to the kingdom of Crudelis Sol which is in need of her help. The King of Light, Dolion, explained to Reika that years ago a cruel and wicked woman had taken control of the neighboring kingdom and named herself Queen. Reika was deemed worthy of the sword of banishment and was tasked with fighting and dethroning the Dark Queen.

            </h3>

            <p>
               Sunny Libertad is one of Reika's best friends. She's an energetic young girl who does her best in school but, is hindered by her ADHD. Though she gives the biggest effort and tries the hardest school doesn't grade based on effort alone. Sunny grew up without a dad but remains stedfast in her belief that he is out there somewhere. She is loyal to a fault which is both her biggest strength and weakness.

                In libras libertas - In books, freedom
            </h3>

            <p>
                Dawn Wraith Kenward is another close friend of Reika. Dawn is book smart and easily learns new skills however, she has a very laid back attitude. This reflects on her grades which doesn't bother her much. Dawn is slow to anger and neither Reika or Sunny has ever seen her properly angry but, they know to fear the day they see it. Dawn is inelegant both emotionally and scholarly however, that puts in a much more vulnerable position that one might believe.

              <p>
                Queen of Acclinis Nocte, the neighbor of Crudelis Sol. She is said to rain with an iron fist and those who go against her simply disappear. She rose to power years ago and broke a decades long peace in her greed. She wields a mighty war axe that has seen blood shed unlike any other. Fighting Luna is a death sentence waiting to happen. Or so they say...

            <p>
                Altair was once another warrior summoned to Crudelis Sol to defeat the Queen. However, Queen Luna managed to manipulate him to her side. Now he is just as ruthless as Luna and stands by her side as the second in command. He is said to be one of the best warriors ever sent to fight and so he is a mighty foe to face. Those who face him don't always live to tell the tale.

            <h1>The story</h1>

            <p>
                A war has been raging between two kingdoms for decades. The only way to end it is to slay the evil queen. It is the classic story of heroes and villains.
